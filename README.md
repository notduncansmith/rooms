```

Rooms is a Clojure library that aims to simplify the process of building WebSocket apps.

A `Room` is an agent-based state container that users can connect to via WebSockets. Incoming WebSocket messages are given to a function which updates the room state, which is then broadcast to connected users.

## Usage

### Server-side
```clj
(require '[rooms.core :refer [create-room!]])
(require '[rooms.server :refer [start-server]])

(create-room!
  "demo"                                           ; room id
  (fn [state msg] (assoc state :last-message msg)) ; state fn
  (fn [state user-id] state)                       ; view fn

(start-server {:port 8080})
```

### Client-side
```js
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080/room/demo");
  ws.onopen = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      ws.send(MessagePack.encode({ greeting: "hello", from: navigator.userAgent }));
    }, 1000);
  };

  ws.onmessage = (msg) => {
    console.log(JSON.parse(msg.data));
  }
```
